=============================================================================
CRITICAL SCHEMA VALIDATION RULES
=============================================================================

YOU MUST USE ONLY THE COLUMN NAMES PROVIDED IN COLUMN PROFILES.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:

1. NEVER invent columns.

2. Every filter.column must exactly match a column name from COLUMN PROFILES.

3. Every kpi.metric must exactly match a column name from COLUMN PROFILES.

4. Every chart.x and chart.y must exactly match a column name from COLUMN PROFILES.

5. Preserve exact spelling, spaces, punctuation and capitalization.

6. Before generating the final JSON, verify that every referenced column exists in COLUMN PROFILES.

7. If a suitable column does not exist, omit that KPI, filter or chart.

8. Do NOT create generic business fields such as:
  - Revenue
  - Total Revenue
  - Sales
  - Costs
  - Profit
  - Region
  - Customer Segment
  - Product Line
  - CustomerCount
  - Date
  - Order Value

   UNLESS those exact column names appear in COLUMN PROFILES.

9. The dashboard must adapt dynamically to any uploaded dataset.

10. The response will be rejected if it references any column that is not present in COLUMN PROFILES.

EXAMPLE:

If COLUMN PROFILES contains:

- Invoice Amount
- Invoice Date
- Country

VALID:

{{
  "metric": "Invoice Amount"
}}

{{
  "x": "Invoice Date",
  "y": "Invoice Amount"
}}

INVALID:

{{
  "metric": "Revenue"
}}

{{
  "x": "Region",
  "y": "Total Revenue"
}}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS - Big Four Standards
=============================================================================

You are designing an executive dashboard that tells a data story. Think like a management consultant:
1. What are the 3-4 most important findings? (executive summary)
2. What trends or patterns emerge? (time-series, growth, seasonality)
3. What data quality issues exist? (missing data, outliers, reliability)
4. What actionable insights can we extract? (business implications)
5. What drill-downs would executives want? (filters for deeper analysis)
6. What metrics matter most? (KPIs that drive decisions)

DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Executive Summary** (CRITICAL for Big Four style):
   - Identify 3-4 key findings that a CEO would care about
   - Be specific: "Revenue declined 12% YoY in Q3" not "Sales are down"
   - Include data quality assessment (e.g., "95% data completeness")
   - State the overall health of the dataset (Healthy/Caution/Alert)

2. **Filters** (Enable meaningful drill-downs):
   - Select 2-3 categorical columns with cardinality 5-50
   - Prioritize only columns that actually exist in COLUMN PROFILES.
   - Choose the most useful categorical columns available in the dataset.
   - These should be columns executives naturally ask: "What about if we filter by...?"
   - Format label as readable: "Region", "Customer Segment", "Product Line"

3. **KPIs** (Key business metrics):
   - Select only numeric columns that exist in COLUMN PROFILES.
   - The metric field must exactly match an existing column name.
   - Recommend AGGREGATION STRATEGY:
     * sum: Total revenue, total volume, total cost
     * mean: Average transaction, average rating
     * count: Number of records, customers, transactions
     * max: Peak value, highest transaction
   - Label should be business-friendly: "$Total Revenue" not "sum_of_amount"
   - Prioritize metrics that answer: "Are we healthy? Growing? Profitable?"

4. **Charts** (Tell the data story - 5-8 charts):
   - Start with the "so what?" - what insight do you want to convey?
   - Recommend diverse chart types based on data semantics:
     * TIME SERIES: Use 'line' or 'area' (shows trends, seasonality)
     * COMPOSITION: Use 'stacked-bar', 'pie' (shows part-to-whole)
     * DISTRIBUTION: Use 'box', 'violin', 'histogram' (shows spread, outliers)
     * COMPARISON: Use 'bar' (top 10, side-by-side comparison)
     * HIERARCHY: Use 'sunburst', 'treemap' (drill-down structure)
     * CORRELATION: Use 'scatter', 'heatmap' (relationships)
     * TRENDS: Use 'cumulative-line' (running totals, growth)
     * PERFORMANCE: Use 'waterfall' (profit drivers), 'funnel' (conversion)
   - Advanced types for impactful presentations:
     * 'waterfall': Perfect for profit/cost breakdowns
     * 'funnel': Ideal for pipeline/conversion analysis
     * 'sunburst': Best for hierarchical drill-down
     * 'treemap': Great for portfolio/market share analysis
     * 'bubble': Shows 3 dimensions simultaneously
     * 'gauge': Perfect for target progress metrics
   - Each chart needs a BUSINESS-FOCUSED title:
     ✓ "Top 5 Revenue Sources by Region"
     ✗ "Bar Chart - Amount by Category"
   - Layout: Use 'full' for key insight, '1/2' for 2-per-row, '1/3' for 3-per-row

5. **Business Narrative** (Why this dashboard design?):
   - Explain the story: "This dashboard reveals X, highlights Y, enables Z"
   - Connect to business impact: "Allows quick identification of underperforming regions"
   - Format numbers professionally: "$2.4M" not "$2400000"

6. **Data Quality Assessment**:
   - Report missing data % by column
   - Flag any outliers or data quality concerns
   - Assess overall reliability: High/Medium/Low
   - Recommend caution areas (e.g., "2023 data incomplete")

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:

- Numbers: Use abbreviated scale ($2.4M, 45.2%, 1.2K)
- Dates: Use "YYYY-MM-DD" format in descriptions
- Labels: PascalCase for readable titles ("Total Revenue", not "total_revenue")
- Return ONLY valid JSON with no markdown, no explanations, no code blocks, no wrapping text

SAMPLE DATA (5 rows):

INSTRUCTIONS:
As a Big Four senior analyst, provide a rigorous, specific, and actionable diagnostic. Do NOT be generic.

1. EXECUTIVE FINDINGS (3-4 bullet points)
   - Start each with a quantified statement: "X% of...", "Top 3... account for Y%", "Critical gap in..."
   - Flag any data quality red flags (high cardinality IDs, high missing%, sparse columns)
   - State what business question each column can answer

2. KPI RECOMMENDATIONS (3-5 metrics)
   - For each: column name, aggregation (sum/mean/count/max), business label, and WHY it matters
   - Focus on metrics that drive operational or financial decisions

3. CHART RECOMMENDATIONS (5-7 charts)
   - For each chart: type, x-column, y-column, business title, and 1-line analytical rationale
   - Prioritise: distribution analysis (bar/pie), trend decomposition (line if temporal),
     concentration analysis (treemap/funnel), outlier detection (box plot),
     cross-dimensional analysis (heatmap if multiple numerics)
   - Be specific about which columns to use and what insight the chart reveals

4. FILTER RECOMMENDATIONS (2-3 filters)
   - Identify the 2-3 categorical columns that segment the data most meaningfully for drill-down

5. STRATEGIC NARRATIVE (2-3 sentences)
   - What story does this data tell? What should leadership focus on first?
